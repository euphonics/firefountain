OVER BLACK:

This is a standard issue action line. So is the "shot" element above. Notice that there are two linebreaks separating this paragraph from the next. 

If you don't put two linebreaks between action line paragraphs, then the action lines will clump up.
.INT. ARVN'S APARTMENT – OFFICE – DAY

A cluttered bachelor pad. Curtains drawn. 

**ARVN** sits hunched over his computer. The blue light of the monitor cast the dark bags beneath his eyes into sharp relief as he DICTATES into a microphone clamp to his desk.

@ARVN
(to microphone)
you'll notice that there is a . before every slug line, and an @ before every character speaking dialogue. These are not necessary, but they will force your fountain friendly screenwriting software to recognize the elements for what they are. 

As he speaks, we push in to his--
.COMPUTER SCREEN

--which contains a Microsoft Word document where his dictated dialogue is typed on screen. This dialogue. *Very meta.*

@ARVN (V.O.)
if you want to create a new slugline, just say, for example, "new slug interior bedroom." 

And, like magic, a new slug line appears in the Microsoft Word document. It looks exactly like this:
.INT. BEDROOM

(Mercifully, we do not get a glimpse of Arvn's bedroom.)

@ARVN (V.O.)
if you want to do a mini slug, just say "new slug mini bedroom." For mini slugs, it's important to have the . at the beginning of the line. Otherwise, it will be interpreted as an action line.

To illustrate the point, we--

> SMASH BACK TO:
.OFFICE

--Where Arvn continues his lonely monologue.

@ARVN
(to computer)
if you want to use the transition element like I just did up there, then say the word "transition" followed by whatever text you want. For example, to create the transition above, I said "transition smash back to". 

Arvin glances at the clock on his computer display, size, and stretches. 

@ARVN
I should get back to real writing instead of spending more time on this conceit, so here's a bunch of commands.



"New action" – this creates a new properly spaced action line.

"New slug {exterior/interior/mini} {name}" - this creates a new slug line. You will need to finish off the slug line on your own. So after you say something like "new slug exterior Los Angeles", you will then need to say "dash downtown dash day" to add the proper sub locations and time tag.

"New character {name}" - this creates a new character

"New voiceover {name}" - this creates a new character followed by the (V.O.) tag. This applies to other common tags, such as "(OFF SCREEN)" and "(PHONE)"

"New wryly {name}" - this creates a new character followed by the opening of a parenthetical. Parentheticals have their own element.

"end wryly" - this closes your wryly/parenthetical by typing a close parentheses, followed by a line break, and setting the style to dialogue.

"Transition {your text here}" - for example, "transition cut to" you will get the standard "CUT TO:" element.

"New comment heading" - this will create a hashtag character, like the below:

# This is comment heading, and will not appear in the body of your script. Note that fountain comments /* like these */ will not be interpreted as comments and instead appear as action lines in most screenwriting programs.

There are more commands that I am not going to write up at the moment. Look through the scripts and you will see other options, and the need for more.
